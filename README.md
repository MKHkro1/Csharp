# C# Programming Language Learning Notes

This repository contains my personal learning notes on the C# programming language, with a focus on game development using Unity. It includes fundamentals, advanced topics, best practices, practical examples, and specialized content on creating fusion versions of games like Plants vs. Zombies, including secondary creation (fan-made) plants and related development techniques. These notes are compiled from official documentation, online tutorials, books, hands-on experiments, and community resources. This is an ongoing project, and contributions are welcome!

## Overview

C# (pronounced "C Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It's widely used for building Windows applications, web services, and especially games with Unity. This repository provides structured notes for beginners and intermediate learners, covering syntax, concepts, real-world applications, and game-specific development.

Key topics include:
- Basic syntax and data types
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles
- Advanced features like LINQ, async/await, and generics
- Frameworks such as .NET Core, ASP.NET, and Entity Framework
- Unity game development: Scripting, asset management, physics, UI, and animations
- Plants vs. Zombies fusion edition secondary creations: Developing fan-made plants, game mechanics fusion (e.g., combining elements from different game versions), modding techniques, and custom plant behaviors using C# in Unity
- Best practices, debugging tips, and common pitfalls in game dev and modding

The notes emphasize practical integration, such as using C# scripts in Unity to create custom game objects, AI for zombies/plants, and procedural generation for fusion-style gameplay.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders for easy navigation:

- **/basics/**: Notes on introductory concepts like variables, control structures, and functions.
- **/oop/**: In-depth coverage of classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces.
- **/advanced/**: Topics including delegates, events, multithreading, and performance optimization.
- **/frameworks/**: Guides on .NET ecosystem tools and libraries.
- **/unity/**: Unity-specific notes, including scene management, coroutines, raycasting, and shader basics with C#.
- **/pvz-fusion/**: Specialized content on Plants vs. Zombies fusion editions, such as developing secondary creation plants (e.g., custom abilities, animations, and balancing), game fusion mechanics, modding tools, and Unity integration for fan-made versions.
- **/examples/**: Code snippets, small projects, and Unity scenes demonstrating concepts, including PVZ-inspired plant/zombie scripts.
- **/resources/**: Links to books, websites, videos, Unity documentation, and PVZ modding communities for further learning.
- **/images/**: Diagrams, flowcharts, screenshots, and Unity editor visuals to illustrate ideas.

Each note is written in Markdown format for readability. Files are named descriptively, e.g., `unity-scripting-basics.md` or `pvz-fusion-custom-plant-dev.md`.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/csharp-learning-notes.git`
2. Browse the folders and read the Markdown files using any text editor or Markdown viewer.
3. Search for specific topics using GitHub's search feature or locally with tools like `grep`.
4. Run code examples in your local environment using Visual Studio, VS Code, .NET CLI, or Unity Editor for game-related content.
5. If you're new to GitHub, check out the [official guides](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started) for more help.

Feel free to fork this repo and customize it for your own learning journey, especially if you're into game modding!

## Contributing

Contributions are encouraged! If you have additions, corrections, new notes, or Unity/PVZ examples to share:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. Make your changes and commit: `git commit -m "Add notes on PVZ fusion plant development"`
4. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature`
