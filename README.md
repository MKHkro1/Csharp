# C# Programming Language Learning Notes

This repository contains my personal learning notes on the C# programming language. It covers fundamentals, advanced topics, best practices, and practical examples. These notes are compiled from official documentation, online tutorials, books, and hands-on experiments. This is an ongoing project, and contributions are welcome!

## Overview

C# (pronounced "C Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It's widely used for building Windows applications, web services, games (with Unity), and more. This repository aims to provide structured notes for beginners and intermediate learners, including syntax, concepts, and real-world applications.

Key topics include:
- Basic syntax and data types
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles
- Advanced features like LINQ, async/await, and generics
- Frameworks such as .NET Core, ASP.NET, and Entity Framework
- Best practices, debugging tips, and common pitfalls

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders for easy navigation:

- **/basics/**: Notes on introductory concepts like variables, control structures, and functions.
- **/oop/**: In-depth coverage of classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces.
- **/advanced/**: Topics including delegates, events, multithreading, and performance optimization.
- **/frameworks/**: Guides on .NET ecosystem tools and libraries.
- **/examples/**: Code snippets and small projects to demonstrate concepts.
- **/resources/**: Links to books, websites, videos, and tools for further learning.
- **/images/**: Diagrams, flowcharts, and screenshots to illustrate ideas.

Each note is written in Markdown format for readability. Files are named descriptively, e.g., `basics-variables-and-types.md`.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/csharp-learning-notes.git`
2. Browse the folders and read the Markdown files using any text editor or Markdown viewer.
3. Search for specific topics using GitHub's search feature or locally with tools like `grep`.
4. Run code examples in your local environment using Visual Studio, VS Code, or .NET CLI.
